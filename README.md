  ## About the project

  This is a book store website that has been developed using Next.js, Tailwind, and TypeScript. It supports the following fetures:

  - view list of books along with `title`, `author`, and `price` that is pulled from a `json` file
  - add a book via a form which will update the book list `json` file (form also has some basic validation in place)
  - language toggle (the platform supports both the English and French language)
